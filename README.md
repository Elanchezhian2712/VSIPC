# Flask Application Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Flask web application using Python 3.8.0.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.0: You can download it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release).
- Git: If you don't have Git installed, you can get it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.8.0:**

   If you haven't already installed Python 3.8.0, you can download it from the official Python website:

   - [Download Python 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)

2. **Verify Python Installation:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to ensure Python is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   python --version

3. **Install Flask:**
   pip install Flask

4. **Run Flask Application**
   python app.py

Replace `"Elanchezhian Muthukumar"` and `"your-repo"` in the clone command with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

You can create a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository by simply adding this content to a file named `README.md` in the root of your repository. GitHub will automatically render it as a nicely formatted README when someone visits your repository.
